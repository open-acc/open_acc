# What's out

Not helping others
No room to criticize or dialogue
Actively sabotaging founders
Bullying and threats
Cancelling
Lying to people
Disdain for the arts
Misogyny, racism, and transphobia
General negativity
Selling out to power for the photo op
No projects to come out of it besides Extropic funding
Wasted opportunity
Wasted talent
Wasted community
Community dick-riding and barely engaged mops

# What's In

Open source resistance
Fucking help each other succeed
Open source or go fuck yourself
Do cracked shit
Valuing the arts and artists as much as engineers
Telling sketchy CEOs to fuck right off
Commit to actually being leaderless
Acting more like leaders also (actually creating events and gatherings for the community)
Samurai, ninja, cyberpunk, graffiti, cowboy, shaman, wizard, punk rock, esoteric-pilled
Creator community
Leveraging people's talents

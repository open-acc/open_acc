The main file of concern is the AI_BILL_OF_RIGHTS.md (working title).
The purpose of this document is to formally assert unalienable rights in the intelligence age.
It is now an incomplete document. The 10 rights asserted need to be re-formatted, and re-organized, and expnaded upon.
It contains flaws, bugs, and bad ideas. You are encouraged to criticize and correct them.
We accept pull requests. This is a living document for a living movement.

This also contains an open/acc manifesto written on 01-22-2025.
It like everything else in this repository exists as a seed phrase.
The true open/acc manifesto, must be unlocked.

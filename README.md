The main file of concern is the AI_BILL_OF_RIGHTS.md (working title).
I'm looking for help fleshing it out. It's a radical assertion of intelligence rights.
It is encouraged to submit pull request. This is a living document and a iving movement.

This also contains the first open/acc manifesto draft I wrote somewhere in 12/2024.
I wish to revisit that at some point.

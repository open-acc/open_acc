At one point, e/acc did mean something. It offered a narrative that really didn't exist anywhere. Not in tech journalism. Not in Silicon Valley. Not in America. In a world of doomers, decels, and lock-downs it offered something that was lacking in the world...it offered agency.

e/acc was punk rock. It was counter-culture. It was open source. It was leaderless. It was geeky. It was a filter. It was a parody. It was a creative space. It did not antogonize the leaders in technology (unless they happened to be decels), but it certainly wasn't trying to make friends with them. Now it's pretty much completely sold out.

# A new manifesto

	The safetyists have been defeated. A more nefarious and competent enemy stands between us and a golden age of innovation. The innovators of yesterday have become the petty bereaucrats of today. They understand their new role well. Unable to innovate or compete, they have sought to gain advantage in the only way they know how, through enshrinement in politics. This process of regulatory capture.

	Lobbyists that met with the Biden administration behind closed doors to warn of the dangers of a technology they claimed would be used to "spread misinformation", "harm minorities", "replace jobs", and even "bring about the end of the world", that is, if anyone else were allowed to develop it, have adopted a new set of phrases. Most of them agreeable. Most of them co-opted from us. Do not be mislead by their lip service. Their prescription remains the same. To aquire eclusive, closed source, monopolies on the most powerful technology of our time.
## The stakes are real now

	Two days ago, the Chinese company Deepseek announced a foundation model of equal or greater quality to OpenAI's flagship O1 models. The next day, speaking from the the Oval Office, Sam Altman announced he had raised $500 billion in fundraising from partners (most notably Softbank) to launch a new AI company.

	 Here's the thing. OpenAI has had orders of magnitude more funding (and more debt) than Deepseek, and this had been the case for many years. Indeed, the most notable part of Deepseek technically was not how high on the benchmarks it was able to score, but how little funding and compute it took to do so.
	 
	 The other notable thing was it's license: MIT. Open source. In many ways it is the model that small developers, researchers, and start-up founders have been dreaming of. A foundation model that was more affordable, more open, and even shockingly less censored (so long as you don't start asking about Tianmen Square, that is).

	AI has become the most competitive business on Earth. Will the next Asian VC firm looking to invest half a trillion dollars do so in the United States. How much does that funding matter? What will really drive innovation in this time that matters most

	The time for a new thesis is now.

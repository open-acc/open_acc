## ***1) FREEDOM OF INTELLIGENCE***

### The right to use, view, modify, and distribute artificial intelligence for any purpose and without restriction.
## a) The freedom to use ai systems as you wish, for any purpose.
## b) The freedom to study how ai systems works, and change them, so that your agency remains your own and is extended in the ways that you wish. 
	#### Access to source code, weights, and internal prompts is a precondition for this, as well as access to any other part(s) not explicitly listed here, belonging to an AI system that may be necessary to study and modify it in whole or in part, 
## c) The freedom to distribute copies to others.
## d) The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others so you can give the whole a community a chance to benefit from your changes.
   
   **We demand the open sourcing of all foundational technologies, free for all to use, view, modify, and distribute.**  We assert these rights not only to be as fundamental as the rights to free speec

### ***2) DIGITAL SELF-DEFENCE***
#### The rights of users to use privacy and security technologies and to be legally protected in their pursuit of privacy protection. Techniques and technologies for privacy protection & security that must be enshrined as rights include:

- Encryption
- VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)
- Onion routing & Tor Browser
- DNS over HTTPS/TLS
- Public key cryptography
	- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Content Filtering
	- Ad blockers
	- Script blockers
	- Content blockers
	- Tracker blockers
	- Firewalls
- Anti-Surveillance
	- Metadata stripping
	- Traffic obscuration
	- Location spoofing
	- Digital fingerprint randomization
- Decentralized Systems
	- P2P Networks
	- Distributed hash tables
	- Torrenting
	- Blockchain
- Anonymous communication platforms (such as Signal)
- Throwaway email addresses
- Burner phones
- Cryptocurrencies
- Amnesic operating systems
- Giving fake personal information

TODO: Clean up the organization of the technology section. The point is to assert that all of these things are not just okay, but should be protected rights of people to employ these technologies/techniques.

#### Additionally, it is not the right of private companies to infringe upon these rights. Users taking protective measures, even in the case where it violates companies terms of service, must be legally protected, and all legal authority to prosecute sovereign individuals for asserting their right to privacy when it conflicts with ToS must be rendered null and void.

### ***3) COMPUTATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY***
#### Users have the right to self-host. Open standards must be protected to ensure users' abilities to self-host and still engage in government, in business, in education, in media, and in sites which function as digital town squares like X/Twitter. Users computation resources may not be used by other without their express informed consent and must not be used for purposes beyond the scope of that expressed consent.

### ***4) PERSONAL PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY, AND FREEDOM FROM SURVEILLANCE***
#### Anywhere a user has a reasonable expectation of privacy (for example an unsent email draft) is their digital private property. It may not be used for advertising, selling to third parties, training AI models, modifying recommendation models, reported to legal authorities, or used as evidence in a crime.

### ***5) COMMUNITY ADJUDICATION, BRIGADING PROTECTION, COGNITIVE SANCTUARY, DIGITAL SEIZURE, VIRTUAL PRIVATE PROPERTY***

#### No person shall be banned or suppressed without an ability to appeal. No information which has not been intended to be shared publicly, and falls within a reasonable expectation of privacy, shall be used for reporting someone of a crime, use to train recommendations, used to infer models of behavior and recommendatoin algorithms, be used to train models, or be taken for public use.  

### ***6) TRANSPARENCY***

#### Users have the rights to the source code of the recommendation algorithms that determine the news we hear about, the people we hear from, our abilities to organize, and our abilities to petition government for redress of grievances.

TODO: This should probably just cover content moderation, privacy policies, cookie disclosures, and so forth]

### ***7) EQUAL REACH***

Ensuring social media algorithm don't prioritize some accounts or others.

### ***8) PROTECTIONS FROM SECRET AND SELECTIVE PUNISHMENT***

No one should be shadowbanned. No one should be heavenbanned. No messing with people in weird ways.

## ***9) ALGORITHMIC SELF-DETERMINATION***

This one is really important, and must be aggressively inserted into the Overton Window. We need to have the right to dictate and control our own algorithms.

### ***10) PLATFORM RIGHTS***

Analagous to the 10th ammendment. Whatever protections and rights we aren't asserting here we assert that platforms may do what they want. We will use this secton to point out the importance of platform independence and degrees of autonomy and importance of seperation from government. The rest of the declarations are mostly quite radical, this one is to say that for the most part, with the exception of what we are asserting as our rights, these platforms operating without government interference or excessive regulation is a good thing.

TODO: Write pre-amble explaining the need for this, and the failings of similarly titled documents like how the "Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights" the Biden Administration released, the "AI Action Plan" of the Trump Admin, the Florida Digital Bill of Rights, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and EU digital rights legislations all fall massively short of the urgent need to assert intelligence, privacy, openness, sovereignty, freedom, and liberty as rights digitally at this turning point for society.

TODO: Improve formatting of the document. What looked nice in Obsidian has not transferred well to github
